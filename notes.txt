start with `docker-compose up`
you should then be able to see the ETL flow in Nifi at http://localhost:8080/nifi

The flow across the top unpacks the zipfile and the rest processes it into the database

to kick off just copy the zipfile to NiFi `docker cp flights.zip nifi:/data/`
you should then be able to watch the data flow through the system.  NiFi only seems
to update every 30s so watch the in/out byte counts


not all the tail numbers are valid
removed the N because all FAA tail numbers start with N, since 1949 anyway (in fact they're called N codes)
I auto-removed any non-valid characters from the tail numbers

Flight Designations are mutable https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_number
I looked at breaking them out but there are 926327 distinct on AIRLINECODE, FLIGHTNUM, ORIGINAIRPORTCODE, DESTAIRPORTCODE, CRSDEPTIME, CRSARRTIME, CRSELAPSEDTIME out of 1191805 77.6% so I didn't think with this data it warranted a separate dimension
